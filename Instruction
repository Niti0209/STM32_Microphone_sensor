Step1: Open the workspace. First we need to login to the ST account. 
Help -> STM32Cube Update -> Connection to myST.
Window opens, enter your credentials.

Step2: After logging in successfully, create a project.
File -> New -> STM32 Project.
 
Step3: Select the board selector option. Commercial Part number is the name of the board that we are using.
 
Step4: Type the project name. Donâ€™t use blank spaces in the name. then, click finish.

Step5: Follow the same steps to create a new project. Do the following configuration settings. This microcontroller has a 12-bit ADC. 
The default baud rate of the board is 15200. 
 
Step6: Make changes in the code as required.
Changes made: USER CODE BEGIN PV
int mic;
while loop()
HAL_ADC_Start(&hadc1);
HAL_ADC_PollForConversion(&hadc1, HAL_MAX_DELAY);
mic = HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hadc1);
printf("MIC VALUES: %d\r\n",mic);
HAL_Delay(500);

Step7: To use the UART communication protocol, as special code is supposed to be included. 
USER CODE BEGIN 4 
int __io_putchar(int ch){
	HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart2, (uint8_t*)&ch, 1, HAL_MAX_DELAY);
	return ch;
}

Step8: Build and run the project to see the output on serial monitor window.
